Some of the earliest psychology experiments on empathy focused on … a bodily feeling or movement that produced a sense of merging with an object. One subject imagining a bunch of grapes felt \"a cool, juicy feeling all over.\" The arts critics of the 1920s claimed that with empathy , audience members could feel as if they were carrying out the abstract movements of new modern dance.",
